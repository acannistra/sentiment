# `sentiment`
This is a sentiment analysis of outdoor brands' Facebook page comments. We're looking specifically at the responses to some of these brands' more "political" posts. For a primer on this check out this [blog post](https://blog.anthonycannistra.com/pitons-paracord-and-politics-fcb513b262a8). 

To view the latest state of the analysis [click here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/acannistra/sentiment/blob/master/REI_Patagonia_Sentiment.ipynb) (it will render better there than if you let GitHub do it.)
